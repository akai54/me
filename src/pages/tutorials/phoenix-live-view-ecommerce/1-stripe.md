We will need a stripe account to use for our application.

If you have one, login now because we will need our API keys coming up soon.
If you don't, go create one on the [registration page](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

To test it out, let's install the stripe CLI which we'll use to receieve webhooks from stripe later.
[Follow the directions here to install and login](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli).

To test that you have it installed properly, try and look at the logs for your account:

```shell
stripe logs tail
```

You should see a `Ready!` message if you correctly installed the CLI and logged into your stripe account.
`Ctrl+c` out of that command, and lets continue üëçüèº
