## Introduction

I've heard alot of buzz over the last ~2 years about [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) in the industry,
so I wanted to actually build something to test it out! At it's core, Phoenix LiveView is a framework for writing real-time web applications, using a programming langauage loved by many; [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).

## What to expect

We're going to build an ecommerce application powered by [Stripe](https://stripe.com) and Phoenix LiveView. Along the way learning
about the problems Phoenix LiveView solves, some basics of Stripe, cool tailwindcss features, and a bit about reactive programming,


The tech we will use in this tutorial —

- Elixir
- Phoenix Framework
- Postgres
- Tailwindcss
- Stripe

_TODO_ Insert architecture diagram.

At the end of this tutorial you will have accomplished —

- Setup of a new phoenix live view app.
- Setup of tailwindcss for proper user in our phoenix app.
- Setup of a stripe account.
- Making API calls to stripe from within an Elixir Application.
- Learning about phoenix generators.
- Make a beautiful web-app with tailwindcss.
- Make a reactive phoenix live view.

This is going to be fun, let's dive in.
