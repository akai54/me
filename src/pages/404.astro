  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Halt, wanderer!</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Thou hast strayed from the known paths of the Continent into a forsaken nook of the vast Cyberspace, where not even the White Wolf dareth to roam. The page ye seek is hidden by an ancient curse, elusive as a specter in the moonlight, vanished into the mists of the interweb.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Fear not, for your journey needn't end in this land of non-existence. Summon your resolve, brave traveler, and wield your mouse like a silver sword to combat this digital leshen. Retrace thy steps and consult the omniscient search bar, or invoke the incantations known as URLs to guide thee back to safer grounds.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Should all else fail, beckon the guardians of this realm with the raven named "Refresh" or embark on a new quest by returning to the homepage.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Remember, it is your destiny to find the path, for the world of the internet is vast and full of destinations.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Go forth, and let the stars guide you, for this 404 error is but a mere signpost on your grand adventure.</p>
