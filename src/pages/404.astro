  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Halt, wanderer!</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Thou hast strayed from the known paths of the Continent into a forsaken nook of the vast Cyberspace, where not even the White Wolf dareth to roam. The page ye seek is hidden by an ancient curse, elusive as a specter in the moonlight, vanished into the mists of the interweb.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Fear not, for your journey needn't end in this land of non-existence. Summon your resolve, brave traveler, and wield your mouse like a silver sword to combat this digital leshen. Retrace thy steps and consult the omniscient search bar, or invoke the incantations known as URLs to guide thee back to safer grounds.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Should all else fail, beckon the guardians of this realm with the raven named "Refresh" or embark on a new quest by returning to the homepage.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Remember, it is your destiny to find the path, for the world of the internet is vast and full of destinations.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Go forth, and let the stars guide you, for this 404 error is but a mere signpost on your grand adventure.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Wake the hell up, Samurai! We've got a city to burn and a page to find. But it looks like this part of the Net is just a ghost town.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; color: #29abe2;">[ERROR CODE: 404 - PAGE NOT FOUND]</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">The data you're jackin' for ain't here. Maybe it got wiped by a corpo netrunner, or perhaps it never existed. Either way, you've hit a dead end in Night City's cyberspace.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">>> What now, choom?</p>
  <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; list-style: none;">
    <li>1. Double-check the URL - maybe your cyberware glitched out.</li>
    <li>2. Use the mainframe search function - you've got the tools.</li>
    <li>3. Hit the neon trail back to the homepage - sometimes retreat is the best option.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Whatever you decide, keep your eyes peeled and your ICE breakers ready. The Net's full of opportunities if you know where to look.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Stay edgy. Stay alive. And if you can't find your path, make your own.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Pilot, it seems your navigation systems are off-course. The sector you're trying to reach does not exist in our star charts. It's a vast universe out there, but this void is uncharted.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Maybe this is a glitch in the astrogation database, or perhaps you've stumbled upon an anomaly in the cosmic web. Don't drift into the abyss just yet.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">> Next steps for the lost traveler:</p>
  <ul style="margin-bottom: 1.5em; list-style: none;">
    <li>1. Re-calculate your coordinates; the right path might be a warp jump away.</li>
    <li>2. Engage your ship's diagnostics to scan for any navigational errors.</li>
    <li>3. Set course back to the spaceport home beacon - safety in familiar stars.</li>
  </ul>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">Remember, space is a frontier that often defies expectations. Each failed jump drive or missed connection is a chance to discover new horizons.</p>
