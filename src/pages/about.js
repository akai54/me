      I was born in 1995 in Pocatello, Idaho; but I grew up in Provo, Utah.
      Living in Provo until the age of 10, I spent lots of time dreaming of
      being a BYU football player. Most of my summers were spent in Idaho on my

      fun places. I had the perfect childhood, and have been extremely blessed
      my entire life.

      married to my highschool sweetheart, Ashley; and I have two young girls,
