    <p>For as long as I can remember, I've loved everything technology.</p>
    <p>
      I was born in 1995 in Pocatello, Idaho; but I grew up in Provo, Utah.
      Living in Provo until the age of 10, I spent lots of time dreaming of
      being a BYU football player. Most of my summers were spent in Idaho on my
      grandparent's farms, or on trips to lake powell, moab, Oregon, and other
      fun places. I had the perfect childhood, and have been extremely blessed
      my entire life.

      Currently, I am a student at UVU in the Computer Science department; I am
      married to my highschool sweetheart, Ashley; and I have two young girls,
      Lyla and Cecily. I work full time as a Software Engineer for{" "}
