# Heading level 1

This is a sample post showing all the different markdown features.

Some paragraph with long text that I'm not sure why It has to be this long honestly. Sometimes I like to write in sentences and sometimes I like to write in really
long paragraphs. IDK why I keep doing this, but I just can't help it! I really should check my typing speeds cause IDK if I'm that fast anymore and I want to be faster.

## Heading level 2

> I am a blockquote! I have things to say and stuff to do. I will tell you all about what needs to happen. Oh look I can [link to things](https://google.com)!

### Heading level 3

Lists!

- [Links everywhere](https://example.com/links).
- I can use inline code `Array.prototype`.
- Nice.

#### Heading level 4

Did you know markdown can render stuff with plain html? This is a blue block.

<div class="bg-blue-500 w-12 h-12 my-12"></div>

##### Heading level 5

Images are a fun way to breath a little life into a post.
